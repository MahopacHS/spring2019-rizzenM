Modify the program to print `that is not a paint quality` and then exit in those cases. the program errors \n2. What happens when you enter something other than `'y'` or `'n'` for color matching? Re-write the program to print `you must enter y or n` whenever you enter something other than those two values.the program does nothing \n3. Why can't we use Python's `try...except` in this example?\n4. How many times (at minimum) must we execute this program and check the results before we can be reasonably assured it is correct?\n"
