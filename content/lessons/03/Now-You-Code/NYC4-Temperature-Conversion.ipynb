Would it be difficult to write a program which did the opposite (conversion F to C)? Explain. no you just have to reverce the equation\n3. Did you store the conversion in a variable before printing it on the last line? I argue this makes your program easier to understand. Why? no however it ccould be eaiser.\n"
